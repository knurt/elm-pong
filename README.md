Pong game in a browser, based on this tutorial: http://elm-lang.org/blog/games-in-elm/part-0/Making-Pong.html

TODO
----


* Make the Pong field look nicer. Add a line (or dotted line) at mid-field.
* Add the ability to pause the game during game play.
* Add the ability to reset the game (besides refreshing the page!)
* Make ball collisions more complicated. Possiblities:
	- When the ball hits the corner of a paddle, it changes direction.
	- If the ball hits a moving paddle, it adds spin to the ball, making it rebound in a different direction.
* Add a second ball to the game.
* Write a simple AI for a paddle. A simple strategy is to always put the paddle at the same y height as the ball, but this is not very fun to play against. Maybe try an AI that is not so smart to make things more interesting.
